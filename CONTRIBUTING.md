# Contributing to Config File

The preferred workflow is via pull requests for code changes.

If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement, etc., please open a issue.
This will make sure we notice it. You're also welcome to submit a pull request in this repository.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when submitting a pull request:

- Commit history: Try to keep a clean commit history so it is easier to
  see your changes. Keep functional changes and refactorings in separate commits.

- Commit messages: Have a short one line summary of your change followed by as many
  paragraphs of explanation as you need. This is the place to clarify any subtleties
  you have in your impleme∆íntation, document other approaches you tried that didn't
  end up working, any limitations on your implementation, etc. The most important
  part here is to describe *why* you made the change you did, not simply *what* the
  change you made is.

- Changelog: Please ensure to update the changelog by adding a new bullet under
  an ``Added``, ``Changed``, ``Deprecated``, ``Removed``, ``Fixed``, or ``Security`` section
  headers under the ``Unreleased`` version. If any of those sections are not present,
  feel free to add the one you need. See
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) if you need guidance
  on what makes a good entry since this project follows those principles. If you're
  not comfortable with your English, we'd be happy to write it for you.

- Ensure the tests pass: ``poetry run pytest tests/`` to run all tests.
    - If you'd like to run with test coverage, pass ``--cov=config_file/`` to pytest.

- New features should be accompanied with tests for them:
  - Unit tests are written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

- Pre-commit pipeline: We use a pre-commit pipeline to ensure standard code format.

   - Unused imports are automatically removed using `autoflake <https://github.com/myint/autoflake>`_
   
   - The remaining imports are sorted using `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_. 
   
   - All code is automatically formatted with `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ 
   
   - Lastly, everything is checked by `flake8 <https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8>`_. 
   
   Make sure to install pre-commit before making commits.

  Note: if any of the items had to do any reformatting, sorting, etc., the commit will
  fail. You'll have to re-add the items it fixed and try again.

  ```bash
    pre-commit install
  ```
  
- CI Pipeline: There is a CI pipeline that is run by Travis CI on commits to master and
  on pull requests.
  
  - All it does is ensure that all the tests pass and that all the files adhere to the 
    standard format (`pre-commit run --all-files`).

To get started, make sure you have poetry installed and run ``poetry install`` and
``poetry shell`` to enter the virtual environment.
